CS1010E 1112L2P1: What time is it?
Problem statement:
Given a start time ST and end time ET, expressed by the hour (0 to 23) and minute (0 to 59)
Show the total elapsed time (hour and minute) between start time and end time 
For simplicity: You can assume that ST and ET are in the same day, so ST is always smaller than ET
